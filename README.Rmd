__Pérochon et al., 2025 - Müllerian mimicry in Neotropical butterflies: One mimicry ring to bring them all, and in the jungle bind them. in prep.__ 


  Müllerian mimicry is a remarkable example of convergent evolution driven by natural selection where coexisting prey species converge in their warning signal advertising their defense abilities to predators. Heliconiine and ithomiine butterflies found throughout Neotropical rainforests were instrumental in Fritz Müller’s historical model providing the mechanism for such resemblance. Leveraging decades of fieldwork observations, we show that phenotypically similar species present striking broadscale associations in spatial distributions both within and between tribes. Such co-occurrence appears reinforced by the convergence of climatic niche among look-alike species . Our findings emphasize the influential role of mutualistic interactions in shaping large-scale distribution patterns and driving convergence in species niches, spanning across phylogenetically distant clades.

## How to run it

This research has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To run the analyses, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the entire project as a `.zip` from [this URL](https://github.com/EddiePerochon/Heliconiini_Diversity/zipball/master/). After unzipping:
  
  - Open the `Heliconiini_Diversity.Rproj` file, found at the root of the project, in RStudio

  - Run sequentially the scripts found in the [:file\_folder: **scripts**](scripts/) folder. It will rebuild the model outputs, maps, graphs and figures, including the final ones presented in the main text of the article.
