**Pérochon et al., 2025 - Müllerian mimicry in Neotropical butterflies:
One mimicry ring to bring them all, and in the jungle bind them. in
prep.**

Müllerian mimicry is a remarkable example of convergent evolution driven
by natural selection where coexisting prey species converge in their
warning signal advertising their defense abilities to predators.
Heliconiine and ithomiine butterflies found throughout Neotropical
rainforests were instrumental in Fritz Müller’s historical model
providing the mechanism for such resemblance. Leveraging decades of
fieldwork observations, we show that phenotypically similar species
present striking broadscale associations in spatial distributions both
within and between tribes. Such co-occurrence appears reinforced by the
convergence of climatic niche among look-alike species . Our findings
emphasize the influential role of mutualistic interactions in shaping
large-scale distribution patterns and driving convergence in species
niches, spanning across phylogenetically distant clades.

## How to run it

This research has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To run the analyses, you will need installed on your
computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and
optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the entire project as a `.zip` from [this
URL](https://github.com/EddiePerochon/Heliconiini_diversity/zipball/master/).
After unzipping:

- Open the `Heliconiini_diversity.Rproj` file, found at the root of the
  project, in RStudio

- Run sequentially the scripts found in the [:file_folder:
  **scripts**](scripts/) folder. It will rebuild the model outputs,
  maps, graphs and figures, including the final ones presented in the
  main text of the article.
